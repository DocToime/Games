# My Game Collection

Welcome to my game collection. This repository hosts a few simple games for young children that I've developed. Typically they are designed to gameify learning core skills like reading and critical thinking. Feel free to explore and enjoy.

## Games Included
**Odd One Out**

Purpose: A simple game for early readers designed to enhance reading comprehension.

Gameplay: Players identify the item that differs from others, aiding in developing attention to detail and comprehension skills. Encourage the child to explain what it is that links 3 items, rather than just say which is the odd one out. Most should be quite straightforward, but for tricky or ambiguous questions, there is a 'Hints' button.
Note that the questions are mostly AI-generated, and there may be multiple ways to answer. Let me know of any errors, but don't get too hung up on this!
The default font is designed to be easy, and this can be changed to increase difficulty and familiarise with different writing styles.

Audience: Ideal for children learning to read, it's a fun and educational tool for parents and educators.
