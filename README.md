# My Game Collection

Welcome to My Game Collection! This repository hosts a variety of interactive games for young children that I have developed. Typically they are designed to gameify learning core skills like reading. Feel free to explore and enjoy.

## Games Included
**Odd One Out**

Purpose: Designed to enhance reading comprehension, this simple and interactive web-based game is perfect for young learners.

Gameplay: Players identify the item that differs from others, aiding in developing attention to detail and comprehension skills. Encourage the child to explain what it is that links 3 items, rather than just say which is the odd one out. Most should be quite straightforward, but for tricky or ambiguous questions, there is a 'Hints' button.
Note that the questions are mostly AI-generated, and there may be multiple ways to answer. Let me know of any errors, but don't get too hung up on this!
The default font is designed to be easy for young readers, and this can be changed to increase difficulty and familiarise with different fonts.

Educational Benefit: Great for kids, it helps familiarize them with different fonts, enhancing their adaptability in reading various text styles.

Audience: Ideal for children learning to read, it's a fun and educational tool for parents and educators.
